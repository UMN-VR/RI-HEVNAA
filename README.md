**Real-time Interrupt-driven Hemispheric Emulated von Neumann Agent Architecture (RI-HEVNAA): A Brain-inspired Approach to Chatbot Design**

Abstract: The Real-time Interrupt-driven Hemispheric Emulated von Neumann Agent Architecture (RI-HEVNAA) is a novel chatbot architecture inspired by the structure and functionality of the human brain. The RI-HEVNAA comprises four main SuperUnits (SUs) each equipped with an Agent Central Processing Unit (A-CPU) that draws principles from the von Neumann architecture, and a suite of specialized Accelerators. The architecture enables modular, real-time emulation of diverse functionalities of the human brain.

1. **Introduction**

The Agent SuperUnit (A_SU) acts as the primary system manager, composed of five distinct Accelerators: Internal IO Accelerator, System Parameter Regulator Accelerator (SPR_A), State Control Accelerator (SC_A), LifeCycle Manager Accelerator (LM_A), and System Priority Regulator Accelerator (PR_A). These Accelerators collectively enable internal data operations, system parameter adjustments, state management, life cycle events oversight, and high-level system priorities regulation, respectively.

2. **Left and Right Hemisphere SuperUnits**

Mirroring the dichotomous structure of the human brain, the architecture includes the Left Hemisphere SuperUnit (LH_SU) and Right Hemisphere SuperUnit (RH_SU). The LH_SU, corresponding to the human brain's left hemisphere, focuses on language processing and motor coordination tasks. Its Accelerators, namely the Internal IO Accelerator, Linguistic Processing Accelerator (LP_A), and Motor Coordination Accelerator (MC_A), manage data operations, language-related tasks, and motor commands translation, respectively. The RH_SU, emulating the right hemisphere, handles spatial and visual processing tasks. It employs an Internal IO Accelerator, Sensory Processing Accelerator (SP_A), and Visual and Spatial Processing Accelerator (VSP_A) for internal data operations, sensory data management, and spatial and visual tasks, respectively.

3. **Motor, Inertial, and Spatial Coordination SuperUnit**

Complementing the architecture is the Motor, Inertial, and Spatial Coordination Accelerator SuperUnit (MISCA_SU). This SU interfaces with hardware components such as servos, a LiDAR module, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). It collaborates with the RH_SU's Visual and Spatial Processing Accelerator to coordinate movement based on visual and spatial inputs.

4. **Inter-SU Communication and Task Management**

The Internal IO Accelerators within each SU facilitate communication via the 'Agent Bus' and 'Interhemispheric Bus', structured logs accessible by various system parts. Access is controlled through lock requests and priority levels to prevent data collisions. A defining feature of the RI-HEVNAA architecture is the use of 'Pathways' and 'Tasks'. A Pathway, a JSON file, outlines a sequence of Tasks to be performed. Each Task, a Python file, executes a specific operation, with the output of one Task serving as the input to the next, allowing for modular task management.

5. **Code Implementation and Deployment**

The architecture's code implementation is segregated into Python files for each Accelerator and Task set, promoting modularity and reusability. It employs JSON for structured data storage, allowing for flexible and human-readable data representation. The architecture is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu, utilizing seven independent programs—each SU equipped with an A-CPU and a set of Accelerators.

6. **Conclusion**

The RI-HEVNAA presents a sophisticated blend of principles from computer science and neuroscience, creating a system capable of emulating the diverse functionalities of the human brain in real-time. Its intricate design, combined with modern technologies and

programming practices, contributes to a comprehensive and dynamic system capable of interacting with its environment in an adaptive, coordinated manner. The introduction of the Motor, Inertial, and Spatial Coordination Accelerator SuperUnit (MISCA_SU) further enhances this interaction, expanding the system's hardware interfacing capabilities.

The use of SuperUnits with specialized Accelerators and the implementation of 'Pathways' and 'Tasks' allows for a high degree of modularity and reusability. This not only promotes efficiency and manageability but also emulates the organized and sequential operation of the human brain. By breaking down complex computations into discrete, manageable tasks, the architecture can handle intricate operations while maintaining flexibility and adaptability.

The design's implementation on a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu demonstrates its compatibility with accessible, versatile computing platforms, suggesting its potential for widespread application and development. The RI-HEVNAA's design—its alignment with the structure and functionality of the human brain, its modular and reusable architecture, and its compatibility with accessible platforms—makes it a promising framework for future chatbot and AI development.

In summary, the Real-time Interrupt-driven Hemispheric Emulated von Neumann Agent Architecture (RI-HEVNAA) offers a novel approach to chatbot design that could potentially lead to more sophisticated, brain-like artificial intelligence systems. Its blend of computer science principles and neuroscience inspiration, along with its modular and reusable architecture, make it a compelling model for the future of chatbot and AI research.
