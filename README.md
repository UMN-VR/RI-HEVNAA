**Real-time Interrupt-driven Hemispheric Emulated von Neumann Agent Architecture (RI-HEVNAA): A Comprehensive Framework for Brain-Inspired Chatbot Systems**

Abstract: The Real-time Interrupt-driven Hemispheric Emulated von Neumann Agent Architecture (RI-HEVNAA) is an innovative chatbot architecture that merges principles from neuroscience and computer science. The architecture incorporates four SuperUnits (SUs), each equipped with an Agent Central Processing Unit (A-CPU) and an accompanying suite of Accelerators. This paper provides a detailed exploration of the structure, functionality, and communication mechanisms of the RI-HEVNAA, illustrating its potential to mimic the diverse functionalities of the human brain.

**1. Introduction**

The RI-HEVNAA aims to emulate the human brain's structure and functions through a modular, hierarchical, and interconnected system. It comprises four SuperUnits (A_SU, LH_SU, RH_SU, and MISCA_SU), each equipped with an A-CPU and associated Accelerators. In total, the system employs seven Unix processes and an integrated Bus manager within the A_SU, promoting efficient real-time interaction with the environment and complex information processing.

**2. SuperUnits and Agent Central Processing Units (A-CPUs)**

Each SU incorporates an A-CPU, inspired by the von Neumann architecture, comprising a Control Unit, Memory Unit, and Execution Unit. This combination facilitates the regulation, storage, and processing of information, mirroring the hierarchical information processing prevalent in the human brain.

2.1. **Agent SuperUnit (A_SU)**

The A_SU, the high-level manager of the chatbot system, houses five Accelerators and the Bus manager:

    - System Parameter Regulator Accelerator (SPR_A): Manages low-complexity signals across the system.
    - State Control Accelerator (SC_A): Oversees the overall system state.
    - Lifecycle Manager Accelerator (LM_A): Supervises lifecycle events, such as sleep schedules.
    - System Priority Regulator Accelerator (PR_A): Handles high-level system priorities.
    - Bus Manager: Manages the writing to JSON files and oversees the operation of the Agent Bus and Interhemispheric Bus, preventing data collisions using lock requests and priority levels.

2.2. **Left Hemisphere SuperUnit (LH_SU)**

The LH_SU, emulating the left hemisphere of the human brain, focuses on speech and language processing. It incorporates two Accelerators:

    - Linguistic Processing Accelerator (LP_A): Handles language and speech-related tasks.
    - Motor Coordination Accelerator (MC_A): Interfaces with the robot's physical movements.

2.3. **Right Hemisphere SuperUnit (RH_SU)**

The RH_SU, emulating the right hemisphere, is dedicated to spatial and visual processing. It houses two Accelerators:

    - Sensory Processing Accelerator (SP_A): Manages sensory inputs from the environment.
    - Visual and Spatial Processing Accelerator (VSP_A): Handles spatial and visual-related tasks.

2.4. **Motor, Inertial, and Spatial Coordination Accelerator SuperUnit (MISCA_SU)**

The MISCA_SU interfaces with hardware components such as servos, a LiDAR module, and 11 Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). It communicates with the Visual Processing Accelerator in the RH_SU and calculates movements for the 12 servos to execute desired actions.

**3. Pathways and Tasks Paradigm**

Pathways are JSON files outlining sequences of Tasks to be executed. Each Task is a Python file that performs a specific operation, and the output of one Task serves as the input

to the subsequent Task. This paradigm facilitates modularization and promotes code reuse, mirroring the brainâ€™s functionality.

3.1. **Role of A-CPU in Pathways and Tasks**

The A-CPU in each SuperUnit orchestrates the execution of Pathways and Tasks. It reads the Pathways, sequences the Tasks, and ensures that data flow through the Tasks is managed efficiently.

**4. Code Implementation and Deployment**

The RI-HEVNAA is implemented in Python, with JSON used for structured data storage. Each SuperUnit and its corresponding Accelerators are implemented as separate Unix processes, allowing for concurrent execution and interprocess communication.

4.1. **Deployment on Raspberry Pi**

The architecture is designed for deployment on a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu, reflecting the compact and efficient design goals of the architecture, which allow for real-time processing and interaction with the environment using relatively low-cost hardware.

**5. Conclusion**

The RI-HEVNAA offers a novel chatbot architecture that integrates principles from neuroscience and computer science to emulate the human brain's functionalities. By employing a hierarchical structure of SuperUnits, each equipped with A-CPUs and specialized Accelerators, the RI-HEVNAA achieves complex information processing and real-time interactions. The architecture's modularity, facilitated by the Pathways and Tasks paradigm, promotes code reuse and scalability. The integration of the Motor, Inertial, and Spatial Coordination Accelerator SuperUnit (MISCA_SU) extends the system's capabilities, enabling more sophisticated interactions with physical environments. The integration of the Bus Manager within the A_SU streamlines the system's processes, maintaining the total Unix processes to eight. The RI-HEVNAA's deployment on Raspberry Pi demonstrates its adaptability and potential for development on accessible platforms. As AI continues to evolve, the RI-HEVNAA stands as a promising foundation for developing more advanced, human-like artificial intelligence systems.
